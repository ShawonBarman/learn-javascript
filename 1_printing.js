In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer will recognize them and treats them specially.

write console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
    (1)Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
    (2)Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
    (3)Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
    (4)Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
